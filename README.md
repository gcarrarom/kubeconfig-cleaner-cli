I want to clean my kube config file without having to open my config file ever again :)
# Usage

To use this CLI simply type:
`kcleaner`
This will prompt you to remove the context by using Fuzzy Search.
If you want to clean another kube config file, you should use the flag `-k` or `--kube-config` with the path for your config file
